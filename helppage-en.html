            The information in this game comes from Rangi Matamua's book: "Matariki: the star of the year".  Interpreting the texts of his ancestors, he describes 9 stars in the Matariki cluster.
            If the Matariki stars are bright in the sky when they rise in the new year, this is a sign of a bountiful harvest for the coming year.   Each star also has its own special significance, as described below.
